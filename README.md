# CSV and TSV Parser

The parser is developed in pure JavaScript on OOP and developed to display tables from CSV and TSV files, taking into account voids, quotes, and various separators such as `','`, `';'`, `'\t'`, and `'|'`.

## Division into files

You can transfer the "CsvParser" class and use it in your projects.
